# Sample Datasets and Templates

This folder contains example data and a starter notebook that you can copy into a new project. The goal is to help new users explore Observable Framework without needing to supply their own data first.

- **data/us-state-capitals.csv** – Small sample dataset of U.S. state capitals.
- **sample-dashboard.md** – Simple notebook that plots the dataset using Observable Plot.

You can copy these files into your project and run `observable preview` to experiment immediately.
